# Quantium-Intern-Work
Part 1 : (Quantium_insights.ipynb)
Given the data of customer behavior and transaction data my target was to understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behavior within the region.
The insights from my analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

Part 2 : (layout.ipynb)
The Category Manager for Chips, has asked to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.
My target was to find the control store for each trial store before pre trial period and use them to compare the results of control and trial stores during trial period
